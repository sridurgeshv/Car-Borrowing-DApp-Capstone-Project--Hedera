Unlike typical blockchains, it's overseen by trusted global organizations, ensuring reliability and security without relying on miners. It's designed for speed, handling many transactions quickly with low fees. Developers love its simplicity for creating real-time applications and smart contracts, making Hedera a driving force for the future internet.

In summary, Hedera stands out for its security, speed, and developer-friendly environment. It offers a decentralized approach to transactions, ensuring reliability and efficiency while empowering developers to build innovative applications effortlessly.

## Overview Of Project

In this particular project, we’ll be building a Car Borrowing DApp! This DApp will incorporate all functionalities offered by the Hedera Network Services, so we’ll be able to see how each of these services work together in the context of a DApp. We’ll also be exploring how we can use a popular wallet, MetaMask, in the context of developing in Hedera.

This hands-on project will provide a practical understanding of Hedera's capabilities. By creating a Car Borrowing DApp, we'll explore how different services within Hedera integrate to create a functional application. Additionally, by incorporating MetaMask, a well-known wallet, we'll learn how it interacts with the Hedera ecosystem, offering insights into real-world application development on this platform.
